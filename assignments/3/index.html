        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Vireak, or just V. I am an international student
          from Cambodia pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in
          Mathematics. I am very interested in Computer Graphics and 3D
          Rendering, I love learning about the clever algorithms in rendering as
          well as the advanced Mathematics used in those algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I aspire to study abroad in Germany one day, perhaps even pursure a
          Master's there and do research Computer Graphics. I really want to
          experience Europe for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of university, I volunteer in high school classrooms as a
          tutor. I love teaching Math and Physics. I want to share my passion
          and interest to other students and be a source of inspiration for
          students.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really like learning languages. After I am proficient in German, I
          would love to maybe learn Spanish or Japanese. One of the reasons that
          I wanted to learn these languages is becuase I enjoy listening to
          music in these languages. I like music and I want to be able to play
          the guitar and write my own songs one day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like art. I used to do pixel art back when I played Minecraft a
          lot and wanted to modify the game with addons. Nowadays I want to get
          into digital art and learn to express complex emotions in my art
          pieces.

            <h3>Personal Website</h3>
            <p>
              Vixite, a lazy play of words for V's Website, was my beginner
              project to learn the VueJS framework during the Winter break in
              January 2025. The website is suppose to serve as project navigator
              to display all of my past projects. Because a lot of my past
              projects were on Desmos, I wanted to build a wrapper to showcase
              my Desmos projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project has taught me . After using it for a few weeks, I
              have grown to like their Single File Component philosophy a lot.

            <h3>Infinite Scroll Component</h3>
            <p>
              The infinite scroll component is intended to be used as a container
              to display multiple avatars/profile icons and give off the effect
              that the list is endless. This was my beginner project to ReactJS
              that I wanted to do before I started working on SF Hacks website. I
              learned a lot about React and React's Escape Hatches, how to
              directly modify the DOM, how to use UseEffect(), images and CSS
              background images, etc.
